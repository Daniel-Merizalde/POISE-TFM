**POISE Basketball metric**

Colab notebooks made during my master's thesis **"Performance prediction and segmentation of NBA basketball players through machine Learning techniques"**, where I developed a metric called POISE (Playoff Oriented Impact and Skill Estimator), that focuses on predicting the playoff Box Plus/Minus of NBA players based on their regular season performances.

You can see the POISE results for the 2023 season on the following link: https://nba-metrics-app.vercel.app/

This is a metric I believe has a lot of potential, and would like to improve on following versions.
